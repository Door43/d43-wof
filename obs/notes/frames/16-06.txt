**Gideon's** father had an **altar** dedicated to an **idol**. **God** told Gideon **to tear down** that altar. But Gideon was **afraid of the people**, so he **waited until nighttime**. Then he tore down the altar and smashed it to pieces. He built a new altar to God near where the altar to the idol used to be and made a **sacrifice** to God on it.
