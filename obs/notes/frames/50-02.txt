As we wait for **Jesus** to return, **God** wants us to live in a way that is **holy** and that honors him. He also wants us to tell others about his **kingdom**. When Jesus was living on earth he said, “My **disciples** will **preach** the **good news** about the kingdom of God to people everywhere in the world, and then **the end will come**.”
